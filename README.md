# Solo_projects
There are two files in this repository:
The first being a simple customisable web scraper using Python and BeautifulSoup. I constructed a scraper directed to Yahoo Finance, and programmed it to store the gathered data in a JSON file. I used this data to plot graphs showing the change in stock prices over time.  
The second being a snapshot of mySQL queries and alterations.
